This isn't about quick fixes or temporary changes—it's about creating a life filled with energy, balance, and joy.\n\n**The Power of Intention**\n\nAn intention is more than a goal. While goals are external targets, intentions are internal commitments. When you set a wellness intention, you're declaring how you want to feel and who you want to become.\n\n**Why Your 'Why' Matters**\n\nResearch shows that people who connect their health goals to deeper values—like being present for their children, having energy for their passions, or feeling confident in their bodies—are significantly more likely to maintain lasting change.\n\nYour 'why' becomes your anchor when challenges arise. It transforms 'I have to' into 'I choose to.'",

Increase this if you're active, in warm weather, or consuming caffeine.\n\n**The Hydration Ritual**\n\nTransform water drinking from a chore into a ritual:\n- Start each morning with a glass of water\n- Drink a glass before each meal (this also aids digestion)\n- Keep water visible and accessible throughout the day\n- Listen to your body's thirst signals",

Others diet strictly but remain sedentary, missing the mental and physical benefits of movement.\n\nThe 70/30 harmony means:\n- You can't eat whatever you want just because you exercised\n- You shouldn't skip movement just because you ate well\n- Balance creates sustainable, long-term results",

This is especially important after carbohydrate-rich meals.\n\n**What Kind of Movement?**\n\nPost-meal movement should be gentle:\n- A casual walk (not power walking)\n- Light household chores\n- Gentle stretching\n- Standing and moving rather than sitting\n\n**Avoid intense exercise immediately after eating, which can disrupt digestion.**\n\n**Practical Application**\n\n- Walk around the block after dinner\n- Take the stairs back to your desk after lunch\n- Do gentle stretches after breakfast\n- Clean up the kitchen slowly after meals\n\n**Making It a Habit**\n\nLink post-meal movement to your eating ritual. Just as you automatically clear your plate, add a brief movement session.",

Consider:\n- **Morning**: Gets it done before excuses arise\n- **Lunch**: Breaks up the workday\n- **Evening**: Decompresses after work\n\n**Overcoming 'I Don't Have Time'**\n\n- 5 minutes is 0.3% of your day\n- Movement improves energy and productivity\n- Schedule it like an important meeting\n- Remember: some movement beats no movement\n\n**Rest Days Matter**\n\nInclude 1-2 rest days per week.
